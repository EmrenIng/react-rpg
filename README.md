# React RPG
React Rpg is an intro into what video game creation might be like. I set out to make something reminiscent of older rpgs working with a 2D world and a single player character to navigate that world. I picked React due to its relevance in the coding world and Redux was brought in to supplement this choice. 

Currently the user interaction with the world is a single chest 'hidden' amongst some bushed. Once the player reaches the chest they recive an alert and a stawberry is added to the player inventory for their efforts.
